%  (1) Use an equal sign to specify exact lower and upper bounds that are
%      read from the data files and/or here.
%      e.g.    y[0] = timespec  lowerboundspec  upperboundspec   goalwidth
%  (2) Use a colon to specify data from the files that will be processed 
%      through tasle to give lower and upper bounds.
%      e.g.    y[0] : timespec  dataspec  tasle_tmin   goalwidth

%       [file%d][col%d]{+-}%lf

%       file%d, if present, specifies the file (default is "file0")
%       col%d, if present, specifies the column in the file (default is null)
%       %lf is a value added/subtracted to the data.
